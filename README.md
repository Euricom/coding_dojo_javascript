## Setup

To get started on the coding kat, we recommend dividing into groups of 2 or 3 developers. It's helpful to have at least one member of each group with some React knowledge. 

Be sure to carefully read and follow the requirements outlined in the challenge, which can be found in the [GUESTBOOK.md](./docs/GUESTBOOK.md) file. Additionally you find here some tips and hints on how to get started.

If you encounter any issues or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to the coaches, Peter or Jonas, or to ask for help from other groups.

Assuming everything goes smoothly, you can even extend the application with additional features of your own choosing. Have fun!
